# Single-Linked-Lists

**Overview**
<br>
This project provides a Python implementation of a Singly Linked List (SLL), a fundamental data structure. It includes a comprehensive set of operations to manipulate and query the list, making it a valuable resource for learning and applying linked list concepts.

<br>

**Features**
1. Basic List Operations: Includes methods to append data, calculate the length of the list, and convert the list to a string.
2. Data Manipulation: Methods to add, find, delete, and delete all instances of specific data in the list.
3. Summation and Counting: Functions to sum up values and count occurrences of data in the list.
4. Special Functionality: help_mario function to reorder the list based on a specific data element.
5. Robust Testing: Equipped with methods to compare lists (__eq__) and debug (__repr__).

<br>

**Usage**
1. Creating an SLL: Instantiate the SinglyLinkedList class.
2. Manipulating the List: Use methods like append, delete, find, and delete_all to modify the list.
3. Querying the List: Apply length, find, and find_sum to retrieve information from the list.
4. Special Operations: Use the help_mario function to rearrange the list based on a specific condition.
5. Viewing the List: Convert the list to a string for easy visualization.

**Requirements**
<br>
Python 3.x

<br>

**Ideal For**
<br>
Students and developers learning about linked lists and data structures.
Python programmers looking for a reference implementation of a singly linked list.
Use cases requiring basic list operations without the overhead of built-in list structures.
